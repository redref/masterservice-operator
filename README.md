Masterservice-operator is a tooling operator using a CustomResource named `MasterService`. This custom resource creates 2 services :
  * `name`-all : kubernetes service created with the given `serviceSpec`
  * `name` : kubernetes empty service populated by the operator

The second service will be populated with the oldest `Pod` (based on `StartTime`) found in the first one.

A `callback` field in the `MasterService` definition allow to notify (via HTTP) the chosen `Pod` of his election.

## Usage

This operator is useful to implement a master/slave database cluster with no switchover downtime.

Examples :
  * Mysql Galera Cluster
  * PostgreSQL synchronous cluster
  * Redis

## MasterService example
